# Python Network Scanner 1.0.0

## What is this script?

This is a simple network scanner created with Python. This code is heavily based on the udemy course "Learn Python & Ethical Hacking From Scratch" from the tutors "Zaid Sabih" and "z Security" (https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/)

## Commented code

There is one .py file with the code fully commented (for educational purposes) and another .py file that contains only the code with necessary comments.

## How to use the script?

To scan the network, the user bacically needs to provide an valid IPv4 address and the CIDR value (Example: 192.168.0.1/24).

Example 1 - Specifing the interface and the MAC address:

```
sudo ./network_scanner.py -t 192.168.0.1/24
```
